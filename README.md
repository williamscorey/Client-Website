# Client-Website
A website for a freelancer known as YoDe.

Corey Williams, James Richards, and Noe Angel from Chester County High School all worked on this website. James Richards made the homepage of the website, Corey Williams made the order page, and Noe Angel made the Gallery. We all worked together on the frequently asked questions and contact us pages. One of the biggest problems we had to overcome was getting the navbar onto each webpage. It seemed that on every page that we added it to it would mess up in some way. It wasn't until we just about finished the website that we managed to fix the navbar. We encountered several other issues regarding CSS sizing and position properties where certain elements wouldn't move or be resized when coded to do so. 

We used images that our client gave us for our website. For a few low resolution pictures that needed to be scaled up, we used an AI to upscale the resolution so that they wouldn't look as blurry. 

Corey: I personally found coding really fun and I definetly want to do more with it.
